Brian wants to order something that Anna is allergic to though, and they agree that Anna won't pay for that item. Brian gets the check and calculates Anna's portion.

k: an integer representing the zero-based index of the item Anna doesn't eat
b: the amount of money that Anna contributed to the bill`,
	constraints: '',
	input_format:
		'The first line contains two space-separated integers  and , the number of items ordered and the -based index of the item that Anna did not eat.

	output_format:
		'If Brian did not overcharge Anna, print Bon Appetit on a new line; otherwise, print the difference (i.e., ) that Brian must refund to Anna. This will always be an integer.',
